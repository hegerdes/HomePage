        <p> In privious yeas I focused on identifying and solving problems in the software development lifecycle.
          I've streamlined the development process by creating preview deployments for every pull-request and improved
          stability of services by creating user frindly obverserbility stacks. All with the help of highly automated
          processed!
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now I'm implementing ChatOps practices and expanding
          my knowledge of different cloud provider technologies, while further improving automated resource
          provisioning, monitoring, and maintenance tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love experimenting with different technologies and sharing my knowledge with others (check out my blog),
          even though if it
          might involve spending some quality time with your favorite rubber <a
