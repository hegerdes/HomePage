          <h1> My Expertise </h1>
          <p> In privious yeas I focused on identifying and solving problems in the software development lifecycle.
            I've streamlined the development process by creating preview deployments for every pull-request and improved
            stability of services by creating user frindly obverserbility stacks. All with the help of highly automated
            processed!
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now I'm implementing ChatOps practices and expanding
            my knowledge of different cloud provider technologies, while further improving automated resource
            provisioning, monitoring, and maintenance tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love experimenting with different technologies and sharing my knowledge with others (check out my blog),
            even though if it
            might involve spending some quality time with your favorite rubber <a

        <p>I've aquired skills in <strong>Python, Go, JS/TS</strong> and more to be able to implement
          desired solutions.<br>
          I'm conftable with general programming <strong>concepts</strong> and know which tool to use.

        <p><strong>Kubernetes</strong> is the OS of the cloud!<br>Driving it requires deep knowlage in container

        <p><strong>Obverserbility</strong> and <strong>Security</strong> are the two major factors to run reliable and
          trustworthy servises.<br>
          Standards like <strong>Opentelemetry</strong> and <strong>OAuth2</strong> enable
          smooth operation.

  <!--
  Within an IT-Security internship a created a training CTF. This CTF is for beginners and helps to understand Unix, the Terminal, Scripting, Reverse engineering, SQL Injections and Web- Authentication; Web-Scraping. The whole CTF is in a VM. Th get the VM please contact me. Every task in the CTF has its own WebPage with description which is done with NodeJS. Visit a copy of the pages here. The code for the CTF creation is on my GitHub. -->
