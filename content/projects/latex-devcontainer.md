LaTeX is an awesome typesetting system to create gorgeous documents. But getting started is hard, and hosted solutions like Overleaf cost money for basic features.  
While working on my bachelor thesis, I created my own, reproducible and portable LaTeX environment based on the concept of **[DevContainers](/docs/Henrik_Gerdes_Thesis_DevContainer.pdf)**.  
Since then the project has found some lovable users, so I continuously maintain it by building fresh Docker images every month.
