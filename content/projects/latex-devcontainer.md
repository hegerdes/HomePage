LaTeX is an awsome typesetting system to create gorgeous doucments. But getting started is hard and hosted solutions like Overleaf cost money for basic features.  
While working on my bachlor thesis I created my own, repoducable and portable LaTeX enviorment based on the concept of DevContainers.  
Since then the project found some lovable users so I continuously maintain it by building fresh docker images every month.
