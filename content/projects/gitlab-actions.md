GitLab CI/CD is an awsome automation tool.  
But users are often limited to one predefined container, becomes quickly crowded and it lacks the modularity of GitHub Actions. I created a detailed comparisson in this [post](https://henrikgerdes.me/articles/2024-01-github-action-vs-gitlab-ci)!  
With a good set of GitLab Components and some CI snippets you can use GitLab CI/CD almost like GitHub Actions and have a much more clean and modular setup.
