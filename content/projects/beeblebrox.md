Within an IT-Security internship I created a training CTF. This CTF is for beginners and helps to understand UNIX, the terminal, scripting, reverse engineering, SQL injections and web- authentication; web-scraping. The whole CTF is in a VM. To get the VM please contact me. Every task in the CTF has its own WebPage with a description which is done with NodeJS.  
The code for the CTF creation is on my GitHub.
