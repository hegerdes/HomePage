Pacmap is a custom version of Pacman. The map is a map section of the real world using OSM. Multiple players try to capture packages and deliver them to a random position. Ghosts and other players try to steal these packages.  
Ghosts move simulate real human movement, using the MSLAW or RandomStreet model. Rendering is done with PyGame.  
New maps can be generated with OpenStreetMaps.
