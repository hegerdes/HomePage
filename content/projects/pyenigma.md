The **[Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)** was an evolutionary encryption device. It was considered uncrackable.  
When Alan Turing was tasked to break the Enigma, he did not only impacted the course of the second world war, he also created the foundations of modern computer science.  
This project tries to recreate a small fraction of Turing's work by implementing the Enigma in software and breaking its encryption.
