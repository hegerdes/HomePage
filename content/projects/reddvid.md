Having a hard time downloading videos from Reddit?  
ReddVid might be the perfect solution. It consists of two parts: the backend written in Python and the frontend, written in VUE.js. The backend scrapes Reddit with the help of BeautifulSoup and combines the separated video and audio with **[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)**.  
The API can be used in the terminal or by the frontend.
