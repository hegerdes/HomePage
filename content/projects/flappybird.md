You gotta jump on the hype. This is a simple FlappyBird clone written in Java using LWJGL. It uses OpenGL Shaders and Vertices for rendering. Just like the mobile version this game is hard. But installation is easy. Just clone the code and run maven on the pom file. Maven takes care of all dependency's.
