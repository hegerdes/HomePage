Do you remember playing the original DOOM(1993)?"
No? Me either. Wasn't born yet. But through a friend I got interested in this piece of computer history that revolutionized pc games with its 3D graphics. I got the SDL version of the doom source code and played a little with it. With some changes and emscripten. I was able to port it to WebAssambly that runs the game in the any browser.
NOTE: Because of copyright I only included the Demo level.
