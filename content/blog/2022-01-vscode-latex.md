# Getting started with LaTex as a Dev

## About LaTeX
LaTeX is a typesetting system that allows the user to write plain text, while the formatting is provided via markup tags, similar to `HTML`. It differs from WYSIWYG (*What You See Is What You Get*) applications like Word in that the final document must first be generated by a compiler. While the output of a LaTeX document is reproducible, minimal and just **_beautiful_**, it can be a challenge to get started for beginners. To get started users need to choose one of the multiple existing LaTeX distributions, choose an editor and setup a script to automatically build the document and preview it. 

This article will automate and abstract most of the pain points and will let you focus on the content - like it is supposed by LaTeX.

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation.
$$ L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L $$ -->

## Functions
The setup provided by this article you will have the following features:
 * A quick, clean, working LaTeX environment setup based on TeXLive
 * Pandoc - To convert your projects between different formats
 * Have LaTeX Workshop an LaTeX Utilities preinstalled
 * GUI for math symbols and some TiKz
 * BibTeX support
 * Spell checking 
 * Markdown support
 * Git support
 * Scientific project template 
 * Have our environment on a remote computer
 * A platform independent setup that can be used on any OS (Win/Unix/macOS)
 * Have a setup that is faster than MiKTeX on Windows
 * Support for x86/arm/arm64 architectures
 * Persistent bash_history 

## Pre-Requirements
This is a *getting-started* guide focused on developers. Therefore, it will use tools common in the software developing world. Nevertheless, everyone can follow this guide to create a quick latex environment.

The following tools are needed for this guide:

### VSCodoe
VSCode is a cross-platform text editor designed for fast coding developed by Microsoft. It is heavily extendable with various extensions provided by a large community. It can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

### Docker
Docker is a universal container runtime that allows users to run various software in a predefined environment isolated from the actual host system. Depending on your system you need one of the following:

| Host    | Version        | Link         |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Linux   | docker-ce      | [Download](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)     |
| Windows | Docker Desktop | [Download](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)   |
| MacOS   | Docker Desktop | [Download](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)       |

*Note:* Docker builds upon functions provided by the Linux kernel. Windows and macOS need to virtualize the kernel. Therefore, the best performance is achievable on Linux.

## Getting started
To get started you have two options: Having the source files locally on host drive or in a persistent volume managed by Docker.  
If you pan to modify and access your project files with other tools as well I would suggest using the local setup. For slightly better disk performance or if you just want to use VSCode to edit your document you can also use a persistent volume managed by Docker.

### Local setup 
The TeX source is on your host OS and gets mounted as volume

```bash,linenos
# Open a terminal an type:
git clone https://github.com/hegerdes/VSCode-LaTeX-Container
code VSCode-LaTeX-Container
# In VSCode hit F1
> Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container
# Wait for the initial pull and build
# Note: You need to have Docker and VSCode remote extentions installed
# Search for "ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack"
```

### In a container
The entire project is within the container

```bash,linenos
# Open VSCode
# In VSCode hit F1
> Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume
> https://github.com/hegerdes/VSCode-LaTeX-Container
# Wait for the initial pull and build
# Note: You need to have Docker and VSCode remote extentions installed
# Search for "ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack"
```

## Some background:

### The LaTeX template
<!-- ![Pic](/img/blog/latex-template.png) -->
The included template was build up over the time and is designed for scientific projects. But I didn't start from scratch either. Credit goes to:

```LaTeX,linenos

% Vel (vel@latextemplates.com)
% hegerdes (hegerdes@outlook.de)
```

### About the Docker image
There are multiple base images **debian-[bullseye|buster (deprecated)] and ubuntu-[focal|bionic (deprecated)]**. All these images have **texlive, texlive-latex-extra texlive-lang-english, texlive-luatex, texlive-xetex, texlive-pstricks, texlive-science, latexmk, cm-super, chktex** with additional tools like **git, zsh and pandoc(not in alpine)** installed. Every image is available on x86/arm/arm64 architectures.

The slim images only contain **texlive, texlive-latex-extra, texlive-lang-english, latexmk, cm-super, chktex**
If you want a minimal image use these, but this might lack common tools/packages.

There are two full images that contain **everything** in the LaTeX world except for docs. These are **BIG** and generally not recommended for fast startups.

There are a bunch of language specific images that are build up on the **bullseye-base** and **focal-base** images. Languages are: **all, arabic, chinese, cjk, cyrillic, czechslovak, english, european, french, german, greek, italian, japanese, korean, other, polish, portuguese, spanish**.

Use one of these if your work on a none English project! Simply change the `VARIANT` arg in the devcontainer.json to `bullseye-lang-<YOUR_LANGUAGE>` or `ubuntu-lang-<YOUR_LANGUAGE>`.

I plan on updating these images every second month.

### VSCode workspace
I added a VSCode workspace file with *sensible* setting. It includes some settings for Docker and the LaTeX extensions. Feel free to customize it after your own taste.

If you want to see what I did with the template look over to [henrikgerdes.me/papers](/papers)

## Why all this
I always liked the concept of LaTeX and its focus on content instead of the formatting. But getting started was hard and I wanted to contribute to make it a little more accessible. I first used MiKTeX and TeXworks, but I found the usage of shortcuts hard and didn't like the PDF viewer. I switched to Notepad++, SumataPDF (both great tools) and a handy script. It was great until my projects got bigger. So I used VSCode and LaTeX Workshop and I loved it. All my shortcuts and tools I used before now applied to LaTeX. I was satisfied until I realized how slow MiKTeX on Windows is compared to Linux.

I love Linux, but some things are more convenient on Windows. I started my Bachelor theses about development environments and the usage of container tools. So I have further developed my setup to bring everything together.

I found that the `tianon/latex` and other image were outdated and did not meet my expectations. I rather created my own image. It is own the large side, but I rather have all my tools there at any time instead of being slowed down by missing them or have to install packages manually. I hope some of you find some interesting tips and tricks in my setup.
