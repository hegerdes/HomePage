      "My name is Henrik Gerdes. I'm a total nerd for information technology and have an absolute passion for solving specific, difficult and large-scale problems in computer science and project management. I love finding elegant & efficient ways to automate recurring tasks and provide their functionality to in a user-friendly way to other people. Abstraction ForTheWin üôå. I studied computer science at the University of Osnabr√ºck (Germany) where I learnd many low-level concepts for programming and architectural design. I did some projects with computer/game graphics, low-level socket programming, graph algorithms and implemented some algorithms for traditional AI problems. But most importantly, I acquired the skill for strategical problem-solving. While writing my bachelor's thesis on applying DevOps principles to the software development process, I worked at a local software company implementing these principles.",
      "Now I'm still working at that local IT company as a Systems/DevOps engineer. I developed a new deployment strategy and designed the entire monitoring, alerting, maintenance and backup system - primary based on OpenSource software. Right now I'm implementing ChatOps practices and expanding my knowledge of different cloud provider technologies, while further improving automated resource provisioning, monitoring, and maintenance tasks.",
      "I love experimenting with different technologies and sharing my knowledge with others, even though if it might involve spending some quality time with your favorite rubber ü¶Ü. ",
      "Check out my Blog where I document some of my experiences!"
