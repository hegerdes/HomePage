            Welcome to my website. My name is Henrik Gerdes. I'm a computer
            scientist student at the university of Osnabr√ºck (Germany). My
            passion is to solve general, specific and specially hard problems
            in an elegant and efficient way and to automate recurring tasks.
            In the last year I did some projects with computer/game graphics,
            low level socket programming and worked with routing in graphs.<br />
          </p>

            Recently I did an internship at a security company and started
            learning some web- technology. Examples are in the software
            area.<br /><br />
