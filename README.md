This is my homepage. Build with `[zola](https://www.getzola.org/)`. This project will generate static pages based on the content and templates.  
In addition to that, it is a fill headless content management system (HCMS) for blog posts. Write your posts in Markdown, and generate a new version of your page.

## Build Setup
